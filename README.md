# HEARO_Design
Kudos to all the Entrepreneurs out there.
This is to inform you that me and my team had a first hand experience in designing a prototype for a product from scratch and can confirm that it wasn's a cakewalk.
This project is about defining user personas, gathering requirements, brainstorming concepts and selecting the best one.
This prototype involves developing a product for the deaf, helping them in independent living.
The result of this designing project was developing "HEARO", a wearable product for the deaf which helps in independent living.
